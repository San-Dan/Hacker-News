# Hacker News
My first larger school project in PHP. The assignment was to create clone of the social news website [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/).

## Install

Start by cloning the repository through Github Desktop or with the command below

``
git clone https://github.com/San-Dan/Hacker-News.git`
``

Open in you editor of choice or simply cd into the project folder
``
cd path/to/project/folder/Hacker-News
``

Start a local server 

`` php -S localhost:8000
``

Go to (http://localhost:8000/) in your browser
